                    It's like they are the Disney princesses! I'm going to recommend 
                    them to everyone I know now.</p><br>

                yet simple games and lots of activities for the young princesses attending. 
                I will definitely go again.</p><br>

                <p class='reviewWithPict'>Thank your for making our little Princesses
                birthday truly memorable. We had so much fun and she and all her friends 
                are still talking about it a week later.</p><br>

                <p class="review">I have known the owner of Enchanted Moments (Amanda) since she was 
                    little and I would give the highest recommendation for her. She is 
                    kind and loving, which is reflected in her interactions with kids. 
                    I have seen the positive smiles and enthusiasm that result from her 
                    unending patience. Her singing is amazing and would convince anyone 
                    of her princess status. You will be delighted that you hired 
                    her to be a princess for your party. </p><br>
