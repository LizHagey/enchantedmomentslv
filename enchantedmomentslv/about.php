                <p class="about">First thing you should know about me is I’m a 
                    dreamer. I am an extremely big advocate of following your 
                    dreams, and I am following one of mine with Enchanted Moments. 
                    I have always loved fairytales and have always considered 
                    myself a princess. Most little girls grow out of this phase 
                    but I never did, and honestly, I don’t think I ever will.</p><br>
                <p class="about">I have always loved going to Disneyland.   In 
                    January of 2015, and again in May of 2016, I fulfilled a dream 
                    of mine by becoming a Cast Member at Walt Disney World! I was 
                    part of the Disney College Program for two different semesters 
                    and lived for almost 14 months at the Most Magical Place on 
                    Earth.  I loved it!  I try to bring the magic of being a Disney 
                    Cast Member into my everyday life, and especially into my 
                    parties.</p><br>
                <p class="about">I am currently in college studying Early Childhood 
                    Education. I have always adored children and love spending time 
                    with them.  I dream of someday having my own preschool. I believe 
                    every child has a special light within them and I try to bring 
                    that light out so that it can shine a little brighter.</p><br>
                <p class="about">With every bit of my heart, I sincerely thank 
                    you for the time you have taken to learn a bit about me and 
                    Enchanted Moments. This business is the result of years of 
                    dreaming and is very dear to me. I am ecstatic to work with 
                    you at your party and can’t wait to hear from you!</p><br>
