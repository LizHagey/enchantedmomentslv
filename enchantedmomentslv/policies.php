                <p class="policies">Enchanted Events Princess Parties are children entertainers and only will be present at events specifically for children.
                    If there will be alcohol present at an event with our characters we require a seperate room for the children and entertainers.
                    Although we love interacting with adults, if any inappropiate comments are made to the characters at any point at an event,
                    or if at any point the characters feel uncomfortable, they reserve the right to leave.
                    Thank you.</p>
